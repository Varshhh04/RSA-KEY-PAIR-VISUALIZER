# RSA Key Pair Visualizer

Overview
RSA Key Pair Visualizer is a tool designed to visually represent RSA key pair generation, encryption, and decryption processes. It helps users understand how public and private keys work in asymmetric cryptography.

**Features**
- Generate RSA key pairs (public and private keys)
- Visualize the mathematical operations involved
- Encrypt and decrypt messages using RSA
- Display key sizes and security levels
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction
- Prime number validation for encryption security

**Installation
Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x (for visualization)
- Node.js and npm (for backend server)
- Required dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt` and `package.json`)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RSA-Key-Pair-Visualizer.git
   cd RSA-Key-Pair-Visualizer
   ```
2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   node server.js
   ```
4. Install frontend dependencies (if applicable):
   ```sh
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the frontend application:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch the frontend application.
2. Generate an RSA key pair.
3. Explore the visual representation of encryption and decryption.
4. Input a message and prime numbers to validate and encrypt.
5. View the encrypted message and prime validation results.

## Technologies Used
- Python (for RSA visualization)
- Node.js with Express (for backend server)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend UI)
- PyCryptodome (for RSA encryption/decryption)
